# cdupage
Cdupage's goal is to replace edupage_api and/or all other edupage libraries, so everyone can have a good experience. If someone wants to use edupage's api (cdupage) in a new language, they simply need to generate bindings, they do not need to rewrite the whole thing in the new language (as it was before).

# TODO (goals)
- [] All functionality from [edupage-api](https://github.com/ivanhrabcak/edupage-api) and [EdupageAPI](https://github.com/loumadev/EdupageAPI)
- [] Bindings for major languages (published, official)
- [] Publish on crates.io
- [] Proper documentation & README + Issue Templates
